a thread in the MapReduce manager might repeatedly check if it should shut down.

In EECS 485, you can avoid busy-waiting with Python's time.sleep(). 
The sleep() function gives up execution for a period of time, avoiding high CPU consumption.


Thread: 
    A.join()

    await busy waiting:
        time.sleep(0.1)

Socket:
    # 用 contex manager 无需 close
    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
        s.bind((HOST, PORT))
        s.listen()
        conn, addr = s.accept()
        with conn:
            # 又创建了一个新的 socket obj
